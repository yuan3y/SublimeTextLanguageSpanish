Compatibility
-------------

Tested with [Sublime Text 3 (Build 3126)](http://www.sublimetext.com/3 "Sublime Text 3 (Build 3126)") (Ubuntu 64 bit deb).

Even if I didn't test it, it should work with Sublime Text 2 (any platform) and older versions of Package Control.

Q&A
---

**Q:** There is already a [Dictionaries package](https://github.com/SublimeText/Dictionaries "Dictionaries package") for Sublime Text, why another ?

**A:** Dictionaries is a really cool package, but it is big (29 dictionaries, 23 different languages), and all variants are not included for each language. I want to provide a package that has only one main language (Spanish) with its technical variants.

**Q:** Other languages ?

**A:** This project is inspired by [Sublime Text Language French](https://github.com/superbob/SublimeTextLanguageFrench). You are free to clone this repo, provide any language you wish and add your package to Sublime Package Control.

**Q:** Can I contribute ?

**A:** If you want to add a newer version of the Spanish dictionaries, you are welcome to submit a pull request.
